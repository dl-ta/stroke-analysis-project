# INTRODUCTION
Hello,
I'm Duong Lam Tuan Anh, presenting my stroke risk analysis project. I've analyzed the 'Stroke' Dataset to identify risk factors for stroke.

# PROCESS OVERVIEW
1. Data Cleaning
2. For continuous variables
- Descriptive Analysis
- Normality Tests using graph visualization, Q-Q plots, P-P plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests
- Power & effect size calculation using Mann-Whitnet U test
- Hypothesis crafting and testing using Mann-Whitnet U test
- Correlation analysis
- z-score analysis
3. For categorical variables
- Descriptive analysis
- Chi-square hypothesis testing
- Cross-tabulation
4. Logistic regression model
5. Decision tree analysis
6. Reliability test
7. Compare implications with secondary findings
